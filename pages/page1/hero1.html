## Overview

### ðŸ“„ Overview
**WD-Seatwork-1** is a web design project that showcases my ability to build various responsive and functional headers and footers using HTML and CSS. This project contains four unique layouts that reflect different industries and purposesâ€”ranging from e-commerce to personal brandingâ€”demonstrating both visual design and layout versatility.

### ðŸ”Ž Purpose
The goal of this seatwork is to practice implementing clean, reusable web components, focusing on structure, responsiveness, and style. It helps reinforce essential frontend skills, particularly in semantic HTML and custom CSS.

## Key Components

Each design includes:
- A header with branding, navigation, and sometimes interactive elements (like search bars or icons)
- A footer containing links, contact details, social icons, or newsletter input fields

**Here are the four layouts included:**
- **Nike Clone Layout** â€“ A commercial-style layout with a central nav bar, search box, and multi-section footer.
- **Car Rental Layout** â€“ A modern landing page header with a branded logo and a structured footer with newsletter input and social media icons.
- **Friendless Book Layout** â€“ A sidebar-style vertical header that expands on hover, paired with a minimalistic fixed footer.
- **Responsive Navbar Layout** â€“ A fully responsive navigation bar with a sidebar menu on smaller screens and a clean, professional footer for personal branding.

**Other features:**
- Multiple header and footer designs
- Hover and animation effects
- Responsive navigation menus
- Logo and branding integration
- Search bar and icon elements
- Footer sections with links, contact info, or social media
- Sidebar navigation with hover expansion
- Mobile-friendly design with media queries
- Integration of icons using Font Awesome

## Technology

![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)

- **HTML:** Structures all page elements including navigation menus, logos, and content sections.
- **CSS:** Styles each layout, handles positioning, animations (like hover expansions), and responsiveness via media queries.

These technologies are used without frameworks to strengthen my understanding of raw web development and layout behavior.

## Rules, Practices and Principles

1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeeding words' first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: `buttonAnimatedStyle.css`
5. Use only **External CSS**.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
